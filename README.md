# RPI Accepted Students Celebration
## 1-on-1 Student Matcher

An important part of RPI's Accepted Student Celebration was the opportunity for accepted students to chat 1-on-1 with current students in their departments. Since everything has moved online due to the COVID-19 epidemic, they need a way to facilitate those 1-on-1 chats remotely. This web app allows for the administration to approve current students to chat with accepted students who join a queue and wait to be selected. It also allows for asynchronous matching after the day of the event.
